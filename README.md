### A Simple Yet Powerful JSON Editor

JSON Wombat is a multi-platform IDE built with Python and PyQt5 for viewing and editing JSON files. It offers a clean interface with essential tools for developers and data analysts who frequently work with JSON data.
## Features

  * **Multi-tabbed Interface**: Open and manage multiple JSON files in a single window.

  * **Undo/Redo**: Standard undo (`Ctrl+Z`) and redo (`Ctrl+Y`) functionality.
  * **Light and Dark Themes**: Switch between themes to suit your preference.
  * **Session Management**: The application remembers your open files and theme, restoring your session on startup.
  * **Status Bar**: Provides real-time messages about file operations and status.
